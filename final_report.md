## Introduction
Twitter is a great place to consume a diverse wealth of content. No other platform today provides users with such a streamlined feed of news and entertainment in the way that Twitter does, which I believe is because of the "live-action" culture of the app. Because people and corporations are constantly tweeting updates about the topics we care about, Twitter has become the [four billion dollar company](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-twitter-worth/) that it is today.

While Twitter has become such a great source of media consumption, it has not come without its drawbacks. The ease of use has also lead to widespread misinformation and abuse. One of the most notorious twitter users just so happens to be President of the United States. Whether you are for or against Donald Trump, it is no secret that he has used his Twitter influence to not only [share false information](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/twitter-manipulation-policy-biden-trump) at times, but more importantly to endorse his friends and disparage his adversaries. This is a political tactic that is used many public figures, but is most notably seen with the President.

Despite this, the vast amounts of content on Twitter make it an excellent source of Linguistic data. The [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) allows for interested users to scrape elements directly from the website, and tools such as the many Python libraries dedicated to linguistic analysis make the process of aggregating and drawing conclusions from the data a relatively straightforward process. Donald Trump's Twitter is no exception to this, as his years of usage have created a dataset that is begging to be analyzed. In this project, my goal is to analyze the contents of Donald Trump's tweets and make discoveries regarding the overall trends of his tweeting habits.

## Background Summary
Donald Trump was elected 45th President of the United States in November of 2016. Although he largely came into the public eye in 2015 when he began his campaign, Donald Trump has been a well-known celebrity for a very long time. His Twitter career began in 2009, though, just three years after Twitter was created. Since then, Trump has amassed over [78 million followers on the app](https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/twitter/profiles/detail/25073877-realdonaldtrump) and has tweeted about fifty thousand times. Needless to say, Trump's Twitter influence has become rather significant, but the *way* in which he uses this influence has been subject to controversy.

As stated before, Donald Trump has been notorious for using his online influence to spread misinformation. While going through each of his tweets in order to find the truth value in each would be quite the undertaking, we can still look at some of the highlights in order to establish that there is a glaring trend. Politifact is a prominent website for fact checking public figures, and they have cited several recent times in which the President said things that were deemed false. One example from Twitter was on April 16, 2020 when the [President claimed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deleted a video from her profile of her telling people that to go to Chinatown](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-nancy-pelosi-deleted-v/). Politifact cites that even though Pelosi did say this, there was no evidence that the video was ever on her page. The website cites several other key times the President spread misinformation on Twitter, and if he has done it on more than a few occasions, we can assume that it is a negative trend within his tweeting habits.

Trump also uses influence to disparage his enemies, which can be seen in the many "nicknames" he has given political opponents. Some noteable examples of this are ["Sleepy" Joe Biden, "Crazy" Bernie Sanders (or Nancy Pelosi), and Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren](https://www.rollcall.com/2019/08/26/trumps-nicknames-ranked-as-he-locks-in-on-2020-foes-and-foils/). Rather than attack his candidates on the merits of their ideas, he quite literally resorts to name calling. This can become a common theme of his political career, as he often resorts to simple buzzwords--slogans, almost--to represent his positions on various matters. This can most certainly be seen in his Tweets, so being aware of the influence he has would be quite relevant information.

## Project Proposal
With all this in mind, my project proposal is to simply analyze the content of Trump's Twitter feed to find any striking trends in his habits. If there is any merit to the common assumption that Trump is a notorious Twitter user, then the data should in theory support this in one way or another. More specifically, my plan is to analyze the data from three perspectives. Firstly, I will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis, which will simply analyze the overall trends in his data and try to link them to his influence. Second, I will conduct a more Linguistic analysis of the data, which will be characterized by a sentiment analysis. Finally, I will construct a few machine learning models that will predict various aspects of his tweets. The first will predict whether or not a tweet was composed by Trump, and the second will predict the sentiment within a certain range. In order to do this, though, I my first task is to obtain the data and clean it.
