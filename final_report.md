## Introduction
Twitter is a great place to consume a diverse wealth of content. No other platform today provides users with such a streamlined feed of news and entertainment in the way that Twitter does, which I believe is because of the "live-action" culture of the app. Because people and corporations are constantly tweeting updates about the topics we care about, Twitter has become the [four billion dollar company](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/business/how-much-is-twitter-worth/) that it is today.

While Twitter has become such a great source of media consumption, it has not come without its drawbacks. The ease of use has also lead to widespread misinformation and abuse. One of the most notorious twitter users just so happens to be President of the United States. Whether you are for or against Donald Trump, it is no secret that he has used his Twitter influence to not only share false information at times, but more importantly to endorse his friends and disparage his adversaries. This is a political tactic that is used many public figures, but is most notably seen with the President.

Despite this, the vast amounts of content on Twitter make it an excellent source of Linguistic data. The Twitter API allows for interested users to scrape elements directly from the website, and tools such as Python libraries dedicated to linguistic analysis make the process aggregating and drawing conclusions from the data a relatively straightforward process. Donald Trump's Twitter is no exception to this, as his years of usage have created a dataset that is begging to be analyzed. In this project, my goal is to analyze the contents of Donald Trump's tweets and make discoveries regarding the overall trends of his tweeting habits.
