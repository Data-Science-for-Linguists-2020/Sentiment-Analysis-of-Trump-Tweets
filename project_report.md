This is my first *actual* progress report. In this section of my project, I have accomplished much of what is encompassed by the Basic Data Processing category of Homework 2. First, I created my [jupyter notebook](https://https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Trump-Tweets/blob/master/code/project_code.ipynb) and entitled it *Project Code*. I used the normal libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.), though I also included a useful library that I found called [TextBlob](https://https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/). This library can be used for a multitude of things related to Natural Language Processing, however I will be using it to perform quick sentiment analyses on the text of each tweet. I also import two dictionaries from a snippet of code I found on GitHub user NeelShah18's page. I emailed Neel asking if it was okay to use his code, and he agreed!
